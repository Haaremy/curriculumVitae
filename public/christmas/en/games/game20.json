The elf loads the sleigh with presents from the table. The two reindeer each grab (in advance) one end of the rope on the sleigh. As soon as the elf has finished loading, the reindeer set off. When they pass the mark on the Christmas tree, the time is stopped. Objects that fall off the sleigh must be put back on!",
