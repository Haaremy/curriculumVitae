    "story": "Santa's elves have read your wishlist and passed it on to the Union. 5 curling stones?! Santa's sack may be magical, but the poor elves have to watch out for their health. They kindly give you one of their curling sets. It's not quite as big as a normal one, but it's still great fun. You don't need a broom for this either.",
